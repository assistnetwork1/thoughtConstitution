Below is the **updated, complete, canonical documentation** for:

```
#project_context_02.05.2026-2
#project_context/project_context_02.05.2026-2
```

This version **integrates the provider-layer completion**, aligns terminology with the now-passing test suite, and cleanly freezes the kernel boundary. No speculative features are introduced.

# **Thinking Constitution Engine — Project Context (Canonical)**

**v0.5.2 — Recommend → Choose → Act → Outcome → Review → Calibration Loop Closed**

---

## Patch Focus

Complete the **v0.5.x constitutional migration** by:

• Replacing legacy numeric “strength caps” with canonical **ActionClass governance**
• Closing the full **decision → consequence → learning** loop
• Stabilizing **Intake → Materialize → Choose → Act → Outcome → Review → Calibration**
• Preserving a **thin-slice, runnable, test-backed kernel**

### Non-Goals (Hard Constraints)

These remain **explicitly prohibited**:

• No Bayesian updating
• No utility maximization
• No autonomous execution
• No silent belief revision
• No hidden learning or parameter drift

All exceptions **must** be explicit, scoped, and review-audited.

## 0. Current Status Snapshot (as of 2026-02-05)

### What Is Working Now (Confirmed by Execution + Tests)

• **End-to-end kernel lifecycle is closed and enforced:**

```
RawInput
 → Evidence
 → Observation
 → Interpretation
 → Option
 → Recommendation
 → Materialize (Orientation + DecisionEpisode)
 → Choose
 → Act
 → Outcome
 → Review
 → Calibration
 → Validate
```

• **ArtifactStore is stable and deterministic**
– IDs-only binders
– Strict resolution
– No implicit mutation

• **Invariants are executable predicates**
– Defined in `invariants.rules`
– Orchestrated by `validate_episode`
– Locked by tests

• **Intake adapter is frozen at the contract level**
– Normalizes drafts into canonical artifacts
– Correctly links provenance chains
– Emits RankedOptions with required structure
– Produces Recommendations compatible with strict materialization
– Requires `orientation_id` before action

• **Materialize step is stable**
– Persists Orientation
– Persists canonical Recommendation (kernel-owned)
– Persists DecisionEpisode (IDs-only binder)
– Passes `validate_episode` immediately

• **Choice + Action semantics are canonical**
– `choose(...)` is the kernel entrypoint
– Produces a `ChoiceRecord`
– Binds choice to episode
– Marks episode acted via `mark_acted`
– Acting without Outcome fails validation

• **Outcome semantics are enforced**
– Outcomes must reference existing Recommendation and/or Option
– Acting requires at least one Outcome (**INV-OUT-001**)

• **Review + Calibration semantics are enforced**
– Overrides require ReviewRecords
– Reviews must audit scope + rationale
– CalibrationNotes must reference:
• the correct Episode
• an existing Review
• existing Outcomes (if provided)

• **Provider layer is stable**
– Providers emit **ProposalSets only**
– Kernel constructs the canonical Recommendation
– Multi-provider merging is deterministic
– Evidence threading verified by tests

• **Demo scripts run cleanly**
– `python -m constitution_engine.scripts.run_intake_demo`
– Demonstrates missing-input probing, ranked recommendations, and safe defaults

• **Test suite status**
**203 tests passing**, fast, deterministic, zero flakes

### Stable Repo Pattern (Confirmed)

(a) invariants define rules
(b) validation orchestrates enforcement
(c) tests lock behavior

This pattern has held across all v0.5.x changes.

---

## 1. Purpose (Why This Engine Exists)

---

The **Thinking Constitution Engine (TCE)** is a **domain-agnostic governance kernel** that standardizes **how decisions are formed, constrained, justified, acted upon, reviewed, and learned from**.

It exists to address systemic failures in modern decision systems:

• Information overload and frame contamination
• Implicit value smuggling into recommendations
• Overconfident action under uncertainty
• Lack of auditability (“why did this happen?”)
• Lack of learning closure (“what happened after we acted?”)

TCE is **not** an autonomous decision maker.

It is a **constitutional layer governing decision support systems**.

---

## 2. Design Posture (Non-Negotiables)

---

### Kernel-First

• Models + invariants are the product
• Everything else is downstream

### Audit-First

• Every recommendation is traceable
• Every exception is explicit
• Every override is review-audited

### Proportionate Action

• Uncertainty constrains action intensity
• High impact + low reversibility demands weaker action or stronger evidence

---

## 3. Canonical Cognitive Loop

```
Observe → Model → Orient → Choose → Act → Review → Learn
```

---

## 4. Canonical Artifacts by Phase

---

### Observe

• **Evidence** — provenance anchors
• **Observation** — reality-anchored claims (InfoType-constrained)

### Model

• **Interpretation** — structured hypotheses (interpretive InfoTypes only)

### Orient

• **Orientation** — objectives, constraints, governance posture, override permissions

### Choose / Act

• **Option** — auditable candidate actions
• **Recommendation** — ranked options + provenance
• **ChoiceRecord** — explicit selection event
• **DecisionEpisode** — IDs-only binder

### Outcome

• **Outcome** — what actually happened

### Review

• **ReviewRecord** — override audit + evaluative commentary

### Calibration

• **CalibrationNote** — proposed adjustments informed by outcomes

---

## 5. Uncertainty & Confidence (Canonical)

---

• **Confidence** = how well supported a claim is
• **Uncertainty** = remaining fragility even if supported

Both must be explicit for action-relevant artifacts.

### Encoding (v0.5.x)

• `Uncertainty.level ∈ [0,1]` (non-Bayesian container)
• Stable band mapping → LOW / MED / HIGH / UNKNOWN

Any artifact influencing action **must** declare:

• confidence
• uncertainty
• provenance

---

## 6. Proportionate Action Gating (Implemented)

---

Each Option declares:

• impact ∈ [0,1]
• reversibility ∈ [0,1]
• uncertainties
• action_class ∈ {probe, limited, commit}

### Gate Rule

Let `risk = f(impact, reversibility)`:

• HIGH risk → uncertainty must be LOW, else only PROBE
• MED risk → uncertainty ≤ MED, else only PROBE
• LOW risk → any uncertainty allowed (must be declared)

**Invariant:**
A Recommendation must not include an Option violating this gate **unless explicitly overridden and reviewed**.

---

## 7. Overrides (Constitutional, Enforced)

---

Overrides exist because reality is messy.

They are never silent.

• Explicit
• Scoped
• Episode-bounded
• Review-audited

Overrides without Review **fail validation**.

---

## 8. Intake + Materialize (Stable)

---

### Intake Adapter (Frozen)

• RawInput → Evidence
• Draft → Observations / Interpretations / Options
• Insert PROBE option when uncertainty is high
• Produce Recommendation with RankedOption constraints satisfied
• Defaults are safe, explicit, auditable

### Materialize (Thin-Slice)

• Persist Orientation
• Persist canonical Recommendation
• Persist DecisionEpisode binder
• Validate immediately

---

## 9. Outcome + Learning Closure (v0.5.2)

---

### Enforced Invariants

• **INV-OUT-001**
Acting requires at least one Outcome

• Outcome coherence
• Review-override coherence
• Calibration reference coherence

This closes the **decision → consequence → review → calibration** loop
without violating epistemic sovereignty.

---

## 10. Role of Agents (Retrievers & Reasoners)

---

### Core Principle

**Agents never act.
They only produce artifacts.**

They plug into the engine **upstream of action**, never downstream.

---

### Information Retrievers

• Produce **Evidence only**
• May fetch, retrieve, scrape, query
• May *not* assert truth or recommend action

> Evidence is *retrieved information*, not belief.

---

### Reasoning Agents (LLMs, Symbolic Systems)

• May produce:
– Interpretations
– Options
– RankedOptions

• May *not*:
– Choose
– Act
– Override invariants

All outputs are gated by the constitution.

---

### Recommendation Is Not an Agent Output

A reasoning agent may *propose* rankings.

The **kernel** constructs the Recommendation by enforcing:

• ActionClass gates
• Orientation constraints
• Override rules

---

### Choose Is the Agency Boundary

Choosing requires:

• Recommendation
• Option
• ChoiceRecord
• Explicit actor

No agent crosses this boundary silently.

---

## 11. What Is Intentionally Incomplete

---

• Automated learning updates
• Belief revision mechanics
• Override decay / expiry rules
• Any autonomous execution

These are **explicitly deferred**, not forgotten.

---

## 12. File Structure (Kernel-First)

```

  models/
  intake/
  invariants/
  runtime/
  scripts/

constitution_providers/
  protocol/
  stub/
  runner/

## Status

**Kernel complete. Constitution intact.**

You stopped at the correct boundary.

Next logical moves (when ready):

• Freeze as **Kernel v1.0 (Constitution Complete)**
• Draft v0.6 roadmap (learning signals, override decay)
• Extract public README / whitepaper
• Begin downstream adapters (apps, simulations, Assist Network)

When you’re ready, we’ll open a new chat and **thread evidence across providers** — cleanly, deliberately, and without compromising the constitution.
