Thinking Constitution Engine — Project Context (Canonical) — v0.5 Patch

Scope of patch: Adds Uncertainty Semantics + Constitutional Overrides.
Non-goals remain: no Bayesian updating, no utility maximization, no autonomous execution, no belief revision without review.

6.5 Uncertainty Semantics (NEW in v0.5)
Why this exists

v0.4 requires uncertainty, but v0.5 defines what uncertainty does mechanically.

The kernel treats uncertainty as a first-class governance constraint:

Uncertainty does not “resolve itself”

Uncertainty constrains action eligibility and intensity

Uncertainty must be declared, auditable, and reviewable

Representation (kernel-level, non-probabilistic)

The kernel supports uncertainty as bounded or ordinal—not necessarily probabilistic.

Allowed kernel encodings

Ordinal: UncertaintyLevel ∈ {LOW, MED, HIGH, UNKNOWN}

Bounded interval (optional): UncertaintyBand = [low, high] on a normalized 0–1 scale
(This is a container, not a commitment to Bayesian semantics.)

Rule: every information artifact that can influence action must carry:

confidence (how strongly held)

uncertainty (how fragile/underspecified)

provenance (Evidence linkage)

Uncertainty’s mechanical effect: Proportionate Action Gating

The kernel enforces “Proportionate Action” through gates—not by scoring.

Each Option declares:

impact ∈ {LOW, MED, HIGH}

reversibility ∈ {HIGH, MED, LOW}

uncertainty ∈ {LOW, MED, HIGH, UNKNOWN}

dependencies (artifact IDs: observations, assumptions, interpretations)

The engine classifies allowable action intensity:

ActionClass ∈ {PROBE, LIMITED, COMMIT}

PROBE: reversible, low-stakes information-seeking actions

LIMITED: partial commitment, bounded exposure

COMMIT: high commitment / high impact actions

Gate Rule (canonical)
Let riskiness = f(impact, reversibility) where:

higher impact increases riskiness

lower reversibility increases riskiness

Then:

If riskiness is HIGH, uncertainty must be LOW (or only PROBE allowed)

If riskiness is MED, uncertainty must be ≤ MED (or LIMITED/PROBE only)

If riskiness is LOW, any uncertainty is allowed (but must be declared)

Constitutional invariant:

No Recommendation may include COMMIT-class actions unless the uncertainty gate is satisfied and the Orientation risk posture permits it.

Required uncertainty explanations

Every Recommendation must include:

uncertainty_summary (what is uncertain and why)

key_assumptions (IDs + confidence/uncertainty)

proportionate_action_justification (why intensity matches uncertainty and reversibility)

7.5 Constitutional Overrides (NEW in v0.5)
Purpose

The kernel is advisory by default. But real-world use will demand exceptions.
v0.5 adds a formal override mechanism so exceptions do not become silent drift.

Overrides are:

explicit

episode-scoped

auditable

review-mandatory

Governance Mode

The engine introduces a declared governance mode in Orientation:

GovernanceMode ∈

ADVISORY_ONLY (default)

EXTENDED_ALLOWED (explicit opt-in, scoped, logged)

Override structure

If EXTENDED_ALLOWED, Orientation must provide:

override_scope: a bounded set of permissions (not “anything”)

examples:

ALLOW_EXTERNAL_MODEL_STATE_UPDATE (adapter may update a ModelState artifact)

ALLOW_SCORING_RANKING (application may attach ranking metadata)

ALLOW_AUTO_EXECUTE_CLASS_PROBE (external executor may run PROBE actions)

override_rationale: why this exception is necessary

override_constraints: extra guardrails (e.g., “only PROBE”, “max exposure”, “time window”)

override_expiry: episode-level expiry (always ends with the episode)

Constitutional invariant:

An override cannot expand action intensity beyond what Proportionate Action gating permits unless the override explicitly declares the expansion and a ReviewRecord is mandatory.

Mandatory review on override usage

If any override is used:

A ReviewRecord must include:

what was overridden

why it was invoked

observed outcome

whether the override should be allowed again (and under what narrower scope)

Kernel non-goal preserved:
The kernel still does not silently revise beliefs or self-modify. Overrides create auditable exceptions, not hidden evolution.

5. Kernel Model Inventory — Additions/Refinements (v0.5)
Orientation (UPDATED)

Add fields:

governance_mode: GovernanceMode

override_scope: set[OverridePermission] (empty if advisory)

override_rationale: str | None

override_constraints: list[Constraint] | list[str] (explicitly bounded)

override_expiry: episode_id (or timestamp; must be ≤ episode end)

Option (UPDATED)

Ensure each Option includes:

action_class: ActionClass (PROBE/LIMITED/COMMIT)

impact: Impact

reversibility: Reversibility

uncertainty: UncertaintyLevel | UncertaintyBand

dependencies: list[artifact_id] (explicit provenance to observations/assumptions)

Recommendation (UPDATED)

Add required fields:

uncertainty_summary

proportionate_action_justification

override_used: bool

override_scope_used: set[OverridePermission] (must be subset of Orientation override_scope)

ReviewRecord (UPDATED)

Add:

override_audit: list[OverrideInvocation] (empty if none)

calibration_notes (compare expected vs actual; no silent updating)

10. Definition of “Done” (for Kernel) — v0.5 refinement

The kernel is functionally complete when (in addition to prior v0.4 criteria):

Uncertainty mechanically constrains action intensity (PROBE/LIMITED/COMMIT)

Any override is:

explicitly declared in Orientation

scoped and episode-bounded

logged in ReviewRecord when used

Every Recommendation includes:

uncertainty summary

proportionate action justification

auditable provenance to Observations/Evidence/Assumptions

Change Log (ADD)

v0.5 — Uncertainty Semantics + Constitutional Overrides

Defined uncertainty representations (ordinal/bounded) without requiring probabilistic semantics.

Implemented Proportionate Action gating mechanically via ActionClass (PROBE/LIMITED/COMMIT) constrained by Impact × Reversibility × Uncertainty.

Introduced GovernanceMode (ADVISORY_ONLY default; EXTENDED_ALLOWED opt-in).

Added explicit override mechanism: scoped permissions, rationale, constraints, episode-bounded expiry.

Mandated ReviewRecord override audit entries whenever overrides are invoked.

Strengthened Recommendation requirements: uncertainty summary + proportionate action justification + override usage trace.

INV-UNC-001 (Uncertainty Required):
Any artifact influencing action (Interpretation, Assumption, Option, Recommendation) must declare uncertainty and confidence.

INV-UNC-002 (Option Gating Fields):
No Option is valid without impact, reversibility, uncertainty, and dependencies.

INV-ACT-001 (ActionClass Required):
Every Option must declare ActionClass ∈ {PROBE, LIMITED, COMMIT}.

INV-ACT-002 (Proportionate Action Gate):
COMMIT actions require uncertainty ≤ threshold derived from impact×reversibility and Orientation risk posture.

INV-REC-001 (Recommendation Justification):
Recommendations must include uncertainty_summary + proportionate_action_justification.

INV-OVR-001 (Override Explicitness):
If any override is used, Orientation must declare GovernanceMode=EXTENDED_ALLOWED and specify override_scope + override_rationale.

INV-OVR-002 (Override Scoping):
override_scope_used ⊆ override_scope (cannot exceed declared permissions).

INV-OVR-003 (Override Review Mandatory):
If override_used=true, ReviewRecord must include override audit entry.
