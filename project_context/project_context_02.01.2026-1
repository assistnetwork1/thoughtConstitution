Thinking Constitution Engine — Project Context (Canonical)

Status: Foundational / Kernel-first
Design posture: Models-first, domain-agnostic, audit-first, integration-later

1. Purpose (Why this project exists)

The Thinking Constitution Engine (TCE) is a domain-agnostic cognitive kernel designed to govern how decisions and optimizations are made, not what is decided.

It exists to address a specific class of modern failures in decision systems:

Information overload and frame contamination

Implicit value smuggling into optimization pipelines

Overconfident action under epistemic uncertainty

Lack of auditability, review, and learning

Rather than acting as an “ultimate decision maker,” the TCE is a constitutional decision-support framework that:

Preserves human agency

Makes uncertainty first-class and explicit

Requires declared values, objectives, and constraints

Produces proportionate, explainable recommendations

Enables structured learning over time through review

The engine is designed to sit above any specific optimization mechanism
(rules, heuristics, ML, GPT, scoring systems) and govern their use, not replace them.

2. Core Design Principles (Non-negotiable)

These principles are enforced structurally, not aspirationally.

Epistemic Sovereignty
No external interpretation has authority without passing through internal process.

Observation Primacy
All reasoning must ground itself in observations, not narratives or conclusions.

Model Provisionality
Models are tools, not truths; assumptions must be explicit and disposable.

Orientation Explicitness
Values, objectives, constraints, and risk posture must be stated, not inferred.

Proportionate Action
Action intensity must scale with confidence, uncertainty, impact, and reversibility.

Auditability
Every output must be traceable to its inputs and assumptions.

Review & Compression
Outcomes feed back into assumptions, weights, and future behavior.

These principles are enforced:

Structurally via immutable models

Constitutionally via invariants

Operationally via runtime validation

3. Conceptual Scope (What this is / is not)
This project is:

A cognitive kernel

A governance layer for optimization engines

A structured decision pipeline

A reusable foundation across domains
(news, markets, matching, policy, personal decisions)

This project is not:

A single optimization algorithm

A black-box AI decision maker

A product, UI, or workflow tool

Tied to any one application (e.g., Assist Network)

Applications consume the engine; they do not define it.

4. High-Level Architecture

The engine enforces a canonical loop:

Observe → Model → Orient → Act → Review

Each stage produces typed, immutable artifacts that are:

Stored independently

Linked by explicit provenance

Auditable without replaying logic

A DecisionEpisode provides an index-only container over the loop, without embedding objects, enabling:

Audit

Validation

Review

Comparison over time

5. Kernel Model Inventory (Foundational)

The kernel is built models-first.
Logic and optimization come later.

Ingress / Reality

RawInput — Immutable record of what entered the system

Evidence — Pointers to sources, spans, or documents

Observation — Reality-anchored facts, measurements, or testimony

Interpretation / Modeling

Interpretation — Structured hypotheses or explanations

Assumption — Explicit, named assumptions with confidence and uncertainty

ModelSpec / ModelState — Declared model families and their state

Orientation / Values

Orientation — Objectives, values, constraints, weights, and risk posture

Objective — Goals with explicit weighting

Constraint — Hard must-not-violate boundaries

ValueSignal — Normative preferences (non-binding)

Action

Option — Possible actions (pre-recommendation), with:

Impact

Reversibility

Uncertainty

Recommendation — Ranked, explainable, uncertainty-aware proposals

Feedback

Outcome — What actually happened

ReviewRecord — Learning artifact:

Assumption failures

Calibration errors

Updates and next questions

Governance

InfoType taxonomy — Explicit typing of information

DecisionEpisode — Index-only container for the full loop

AuditTrail / Lineage — Trace chain from action back to reality

6. Information Typing (Critical Design Choice)

All information is explicitly typed to prevent contamination:

Observational — events, measurements, testimony

Interpretive — claims, explanations, hypotheses, frames

Normative — values, preferences, constraints

Predictive — forecasts, scenarios

Decision artifacts (Options, Recommendations, Outcomes) are not information and are governed separately.

Constitutional Rule

No information may influence action without declaring its type, provenance, and confidence.

This rule is enforced structurally and validated by invariants.

Rationale

Models define meaning

Invariants define what is allowed

Runtime orchestrates but does not redefine semantics

8. Relationship to Applications

Applications:

Provide raw inputs

Supply orientation defaults

Implement domain-specific observation, interpretation, and scoring logic

Persist and display outputs

Applications do not:

Define information types

Bypass invariants

Collapse uncertainty

Take action without orientation

The engine may be imported as a library or deployed as a service without conceptual change.

9. Sequential Update Strategy (Maintaining Awareness)

This document is living and versioned.

When updating:

Add a Change Log entry

State why the change exists

Specify which layer changed (model / invariant / runtime)

Note downstream implications

Allowed update types

Adding a new InfoType

Refining required metadata

Adding a new invariant

Introducing a new kernel model

Disallowed updates (without explicit review)

Collapsing model boundaries

Allowing action without orientation

Introducing opaque or un-auditable scoring

10. Definition of “Done” (for the Kernel)

The kernel is considered functionally complete when:

Every Recommendation is fully traceable

Uncertainty meaningfully constrains action

Proportionate Action is constitutionally enforced

Review produces explicit, auditable updates

No domain concepts are embedded in the core

At that point, applications and policies can safely build on top.

11. Canonical Summary

The Thinking Constitution Engine is a cognitive governance kernel that makes decision-making:

Explicit

Auditable

Value-aware

Uncertainty-sensitive

— while preserving human agency.

This document is the single source of truth for intent, scope, and constraints, and must be updated deliberately.
